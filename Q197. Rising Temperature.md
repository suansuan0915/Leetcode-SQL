# 197. Rising Temperature

[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/)

## Things to notice

- different `JOIN` methods\
  - difference between cross join vs. full outer join:\
    *cross join*:\
    ON is not necessary.\
    *full outer join*:\
    combines the results of both left and right outer joins and returns all matched or unmatched rows from the tables on both sides of the join clause.

- `TIMEDIFF(date1, date2)`\
  计算date差值。\
  如果日期1比日期2大，结果为正；如果日期1比日期2小，结果为负。
  
  - 区分 `TIMESTAMPDIFF(时间类型, date1, date2)`\
    \
    时间类型: year/day/month/hour/...\
    这个函数和上面diffdate的正、负号规则刚好相反。\
    日期1大于日期2，结果为负，日期1小于日期2，结果为正。

- `CROSS JOIN`\
  两个表求笛卡尔积.\
  number of rows in result = (number of rows in t1) * (number of rows in t2)\

- 如何比较 date 数据？\

## Solutions

- method 2:\
  CROSS JOIN to get Cartesian Product (笛卡尔积).
  
```ruby

select a.id AS id 
from Weather as a cross join Weather as b 
     on datediff(a.recordDate, b.recordDate) = 1
     # or: on timestampdiff(a.recordDate, b.recordDate) = -1
where a.temperature > b.temperature;

```

- method 2:\
  window function.\
  把昨天与今天的温度放在同一排来对比。\
  **window functions are not allowed in WHERE clauses!!!!!**\
  -> so WHERE clause with `y_date` and `y_temp` cannot be inside t table here.\
  
  
  **注意!**\
  本方法在此题有局限性：\

```ruby

SELECT t.id AS id
FROM (SELECT id, recordDate, temperature,
             (LAG(recordDate, 1) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate)) AS y_date,
             (LAG(temperature, 1) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate)) AS y_temp
             
      FROM Weather
      ) AS t
WHERE t.temperature > t.y_temp AND DATEDIFF(recordDate, y_date)=1;

```

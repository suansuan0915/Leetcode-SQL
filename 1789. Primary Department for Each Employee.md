# [1789. Primary Department for Each Employee](https://leetcode.com/problems/primary-department-for-each-employee/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

Easy

### Notes
- Wrong:
  - don't add `WHERE primary_flag = 'N'` inside 2nd UNION statement, because a person belong to 1Y and 1N can also be recognized as target after filter by this condition.
  - Don't use `UNION ALL`: \
    A use case has a person who only has one record as Y.

### Solutions
- Method 1:\
  union.
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' 
UNION 
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(1) = 1;
```

- Method 2:\
  no union.
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' 
    OR employee_id IN (
        SELECT employee_id
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY employee_id
        HAVING COUNT(1) = 1
    );
```

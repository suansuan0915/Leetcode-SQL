Medium

### Notes

- Step-by-step analysis:\
  1. like [1280. Students and Examinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/students-and-examinations/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50), we need to include\
     parent table `Signups`'s all users info in final table.
     -> Use `LEFT JOIN`, can include all records satisfying ON conditions even if duplicates.
  2. Now we have all records for all users.
  3. `AVG` to get rate.

### Solutions
```sql
SELECT t1.user_id,  
    ROUND(AVG(if(action='confirmed', 1, 0)), 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Signups t1 
    LEFT JOIN Confirmations t2
        ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id
GROUP BY t1.user_id;
```

# [1633. Percentage of Users Attended a Contest](https://leetcode.com/problems/percentage-of-users-attended-a-contest/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

Easy

### Notes

- `SELECT` inside `SELECT` statement.
- Check with stakeholders the exact result table looks like:\
  columns, data type, any duplicates, ...
- `ROUND(COUNT(t1.user_id)/...` don't need `DISTINCT` before `t1.user_id`:\
  because in Register table, (contest_id, user_id) is PK -> unique, when we GROUP BY contest_id, then user_id should be unique.
  
### Solutions
```sql
SELECT
    contest_id,
    ROUND(COUNT(t1.user_id)/(SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM Users)*100, 2) AS percentage
FROM Register t1
    LEFT JOIN Users t2
        ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id
GROUP BY contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id ASC;
```

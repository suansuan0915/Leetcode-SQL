## 2252. Dynamic Pivoting of a Table

See file `Dynamic Pivot.md`

### Details
Procedure vs. Function:\
- Procedure:\
A procedure does not return a value. Instead, it is invoked with a CALL statement to perform an operation such as modifying a table or 
processing retrieved records. 
- Function:\
A function is invoked within an expression and returns a single value directly to the caller to be used in the expression.


### Solution:
```
CREATE PROCEDURE PivotProducts()
BEGIN
	# Write your MySQL query statement below.
    SET SESSION group_concat_max_len = 1000000;

	SET @case_stmt = NULL;
    SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT CONCAT('SUM(CASE WHEN store="', store, '" THEN price END) AS ', store))  
    INTO @case_stmt
    FROM Products;

    SET @query = CONCAT('SELECT product_id,', @case_stmt, ' FROM Products GROUP BY product_id');

    PREPARE final_query FROM @query;
    EXECUTE final_query;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE final_query;
END

```

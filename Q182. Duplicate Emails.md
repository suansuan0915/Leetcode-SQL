# 182. Duplicate Emails

[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-emails/)

## Things to notice

- 类型题：查找重复数据
  - 法一：
    GROUP BY (object that can be the same) + COUNT\
    COUNT > 1 -> duplicate\
    `GROUP BY...HAVING...`
    
  - 法二：
    When need to compare items from ONE column, we can use `LEFT JOIN` (or `JOIN`) and following equality conditions to check match, finally get duplicate items.

- GROUP BY 与 aggregation function一起使用时：\
  `GROUP BY... HAVING ...`\
  NOT where !!!!!\
  原因： sql的运行顺序。
  
- **注意！** SQL implementation order:\

## Solutions

- method 1:\
  join.\
  we need to compare items from ONE column, we can use `JOIN` and certain equality conditions to check any match, finally get duplicate items.\

```ruby

SELECT DISTINCT p1.email AS Email
FROM Person p1 JOIN Person p2
ON p1.email = p2.email
WHERE p1.id != p2.id;

```
 
- method 2:\
  GROUP BY\
  group by same email, count > 1 is duplicated.\
  **注意！**\
  `GROUP BY` with aggregation function should use `HAVING` instead of `WHERE`.  \
  (reason: WHERE is implemented before GROUP BY, while HAVING implemented after GROUP BY).\
  in aggregation function case, if use WHERE to aggregate before GROUP BY, error occurs! not logically sound. (运行到where时，表还没有被分组)
```ruby

SELECT email AS Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(email) > 1;

```

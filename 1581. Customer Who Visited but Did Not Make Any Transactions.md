### Notes

**How to analyze a question step by step.**

1. Visits tables includes all data who visits store, whether buy or not.\
2. We only care about *any visit* of *any customer* with no purchase -> transaction_id or amount is 0.\
   -> Visits LEFT JOIN Transactions to include all data for later use.\
   -> include only "transaction_id (or amount) is null" records.
3. Customer can visit many times -> customer_id can be duplicate, but visit_id is unique (each time visit is assigned new visit_id)\
   -> GROUP BY customer_id, COUNT visit_id.
   
### Solutions
```sql
SELECT customer_id, 
    COUNT(t1.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits t1 
    LEFT JOIN Transactions t2
    ON t1.visit_id = t2.visit_id
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL   
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

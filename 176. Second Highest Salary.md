# Top x Item / x-st/nd Item Selection

Similar to Q185 (Top 3 salaries).

- 第二高的查询思路，利用本题的解决办法可以解决这类问题：查询第N高的数据
- limit字句的用法
- ifnull的用法
- `DISTINCT` here is necessary (in case for duplicate salary records):\
  **SQL execution order**:\
  `FROM -> WHERE > GROUP BY -> HAVING -> SELECT -> ORDER BY -> LIMIT`


# Write your MySQL query statement below 
## method 1:
`IFNULL()`\
Note: syntax should be `SELECT IFNULL() AS column_name`.
Edge Case:\
when there are only same salaries, there's no 2nd highest salary. \
e.g.:  `salaries for all id: [100, 100, 100]`
--> Hence, limit and offset in distinct salaries.
```sql
SELECT IFNULL(
     # only these lines would return empty value (not NULL!)
     (SELECT DISTINCT salary 
     FROM Employee
     ORDER BY salary DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary; 
```
 
## method 2:
find second max salary
```sql
SELECT IFNULL(
    (SELECT max(salary) 
     FROM Employee
     WHERE salary < (
        SELECT max(salary) 
        FROM Employee
     )  # or: `NOT IN`
     ORDER BY salary DESC)
     , NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```     


## method 3:
selecting from an empty table would return null
```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT DISTINCT salary 
     FROM Employee
     ORDER BY salary DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```

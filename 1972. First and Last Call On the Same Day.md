SELECT caller, recipient, DAY(call_time) AS day,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY caller, DAY(call_time) ORDER BY call_time ASC) AS r_asc,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY caller, DAY(call_time) ORDER BY call_time DESC) AS r_desc
FROM cte1
)


SELECT DISTINCT caller AS user_id
FROM cte2
WHERE r_asc = 1 OR r_desc = 1

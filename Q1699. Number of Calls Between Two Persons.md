# 1699. Number of Calls Between Two Persons

[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-calls-between-two-persons/)

## Things to notice
- `UNION`\
  union table needs an alias.

## Solutions
- method 1:\
  perform on the same table.

```ruby

SELECT (CASE WHEN from_id > to_id THEN to_id ELSE from_id END) AS person1,
       (CASE WHEN from_id > to_id THEN from_id ELSE to_id END) AS person2,
       COUNT(from_id) AS call_count,
       SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM Calls
GROUP BY person1, person2;

```

- method 2:\
  `UNION ALL` to get a new table with from_id < to_id.

```ruby
SELECT t.from_id AS person1, 
       t.to_id AS person2,
       COUNT(t.from_id) AS call_count,
       SUM(t.duration) AS total_duration
FROM (SELECT to_id AS from_id,
             from_id AS to_id,
             duration AS duration
      FROM Calls
      WHERE from_id > to_id
      UNION ALL
      SELECT from_id AS from_id,
              to_id AS to_id,
              duration AS duration
       FROM Calls
       WHERE from_id < to_id) AS t
GROUP BY t.from_id, t.to_id;
```

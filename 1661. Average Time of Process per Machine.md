# [1661. Average Time of Process per Machine](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-time-of-process-per-machine/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

Easy

### Notes

- `TIMEDIFF(endtime, starttime)`\
  Accepts only `YYYYMMDD` time format arguments.\
  **Here, timestamp argument is float type!!!!**\
  -> So don't use TIMEDIFF, but instead use simple substraction.

- If use one table: cannot use `avg()` directly, becoz `sum()` is good as sum, but there can be twice for a same process_id. so need to constraint distinct process_id.
- If use self-join: can use `avg()` directly, becoz no dup process_id in final joined table."

### Solutions
- Option 1:\
  self-join.
  ```mysql

  SELECT 
      t1.machine_id,
      ROUND(AVG(t2.`timestamp` - t1.`timestamp`), 3) AS processing_time
  FROM Activity t1
      INNER JOIN Activity t2
      ON t1.machine_id = t2.machine_id
          AND t1.process_id = t2.process_id
          AND t1.`timestamp` < t2.`timestamp`
  GROUP BY t1.machine_id;
  ```


- Option 2:\
  use original table once.

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    machine_id,
    round(sum(case when activity_type = 'end' then timestamp else -timestamp end) / count(distinct process_id), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity 
GROUP BY machine_id
;
```


- Option 3:\
  window function.
  ```mysql

  SELECT 
      machine_id, 
      ROUND(AVG((`timestamp` - time_start)), 3) AS processing_time
  FROM (
      SELECT machine_id, process_id, activity_type, `timestamp`,
          LAG(`timestamp`, 1) OVER(ORDER BY machine_id, process_id, activity_type) AS time_start
      FROM Activity
      ) t
  WHERE activity_type = 'end'
  GROUP BY machine_id;
  ```

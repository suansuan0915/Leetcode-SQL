# [550. Game Play Analysis IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-iv/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

Medium

### Notes

- Add/substract dates from dates:\
  `ADDDATE(date1, INTERVAL value addunit)`: like `ADDDATE(date1, INTERVAL 1 day)`.\
  `DATEDIFF(date1, date2)`: returns intervals between date1 and date2.

- Read question carefully: *"after the day they first logged in"*.

### Solutions
- Option 1:\
  JOIN.

```mysql
SELECT
    round(count(t1.player_id) / (select count(distinct player_id) from Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM Activity t1 INNER JOIN (
    SELECT 
        player_id,
        min(event_date) AS min_event_date
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
) t2
    ON t1.player_id = t2.player_id AND DATEDIFF(event_date, min_event_date) = 1
```

OR:
```mysql
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT t2.player_id)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM Activity t1
    LEFT JOIN Activity t2
        ON t1.player_id = t2.player_id
            AND ADDDATE(t1.event_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = t2.event_date
WHERE (t1.player_id, t1.event_date) IN (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date)
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
)
;
```

- Option 2:\
  No join, edit from method 1.
```mysql
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT player_id)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM Activity
WHERE (player_id, SUBDATE(event_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY) ) IN (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date)
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
)
;
```

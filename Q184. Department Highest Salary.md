## Things to notice
- GROUP BY vs. PARTITION BY\
\
  `GROUP BY`:  is used in conjunction with the *aggregate* functions to group the result-set by one or more columns (usually reduce # of rows).\
  \
  `PARTITION BY`:  will **not** reduce the number of rows returned. (used in *window function*)\
    [aggregate window function link](https://drill.apache.org/docs/aggregate-window-functions/)
    - `OVER`:

  #### example:

  here, GROUP BY normally reduces the number of rows returned by rolling them up and calculating Sum() for each row.

  Look at the results - it will partition the rows and returns all rows, unlike GROUP BY.

## Solutions
```ruby

SELECT D.name AS Department, 
        E.name AS Employee, 
        E.salary AS Salary

FROM Employee E LEFT JOIN Department D 
ON E.departmentId = D.id

WHERE (E.departmentId, E.salary) IN 
    (SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) 
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId) ; 

```

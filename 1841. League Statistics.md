# 1841. League Statistics

Medium

[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/league-statistics/)

## Idea 题型
for one entity in a table breaking into two opposite entities in another table
- JOIN on two conditions:\
 t1.id = t2.id_1 OR t1.id = t2.id_2 (concise ver: t1.id IN (t2.id_1, t2.id_2))
- UNION ALL:\
 在第二个表中分别找出两个entity，union all成为一个表。

## Solutions

- method 1:\
JOIN + CASE WHEN...THEN...END

```sql
SELECT team_name, COUNT(team_name) AS matches_played, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN team_id = home_team_id AND home_team_goals > away_team_goals THEN 3
          WHEN team_id = home_team_id AND home_team_goals < away_team_goals THEN 0
          WHEN team_id = home_team_id AND home_team_goals = away_team_goals THEN 1
          WHEN team_id = away_team_id AND home_team_goals < away_team_goals THEN 3
          WHEN team_id = away_team_id AND home_team_goals > away_team_goals THEN 0
          WHEN team_id = away_team_id AND home_team_goals = away_team_goals THEN 1 END) AS points,
       SUM(CASE WHEN team_id = home_team_id THEN home_team_goals
          WHEN team_id = away_team_id THEN away_team_goals END) AS goal_for,
       SUM(CASE WHEN team_id = home_team_id THEN away_team_goals
          WHEN team_id = away_team_id THEN home_team_goals END) AS goal_against,
       SUM(CASE WHEN team_id = home_team_id THEN home_team_goals-away_team_goals
          WHEN team_id = away_team_id THEN away_team_goals-home_team_goals END) AS goal_diff
FROM Teams t JOIN Matches m
ON t.team_id IN (m.home_team_id, m.away_team_id)
GROUP BY team_name
ORDER BY points DESC, goal_diff DESC, team_name;
```
- method 2:\
UNION ALL

```sql
select
    team_name
    , count(*) as matches_played
    , sum(case when home > away then 3 when home = away then 1 else 0 end) as points
    , sum(home) as goal_for
    , sum(away) as goal_against
    , sum(home) - sum(away) as goal_diff
    
from 
    (select home_team_id, home_team_goals as home, away_team_goals as away from matches
     union all
     select away_team_id as home_team_id, away_team_goals as home, home_team_goals as away from matches
	 ) g
join teams t on g.home_team_id = t.team_id
group by 1
order by 3 desc, 6 desc, 1

```

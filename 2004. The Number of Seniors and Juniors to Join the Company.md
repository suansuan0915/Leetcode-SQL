# 2004. The Number of Seniors and Juniors to Join the Company

Hard

[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-seniors-and-juniors-to-join-the-company/)

## 题型

满足条件（total sum 确定，满足一个条件之后，再满足余下）

## Others

- WITH CTE:\
有多个cte方程时，只有一个WITH.
- 考虑到可能第一个条件也无法满足的情况：IFNULLL()
- WRONG: `70000 - SELECT xxxx FROM xxxx`\
Do in this way: Move calculation into `SELECT` clause, like `SELECT 70000 - xxx FROM xxx`


## Solutions

window function to get #Senior, then find #Junior.

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT employee_id, SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary, employee_id) AS total
FROM Candidates
WHERE experience = 'Senior'),

# only one "WITH" in ctes'
cte2 AS (
SELECT employee_id, SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary, employee_id) AS total
FROM Candidates
WHERE experience = 'Junior')


SELECT 'Senior' AS experience, COUNT(*) AS accepted_candidates
FROM cte1
WHERE total <= 70000

UNION  

SELECT 'Junior' AS experience, COUNT(*) AS accepted_candidates
FROM cte2
WHERE TOTAL <= (SELECT 70000 - IFNULL(MAX(total) , 0) FROM cte1 WHERE total <= 70000) 
```

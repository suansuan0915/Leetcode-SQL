# 思路
```
1）第二高的查询思路，利用本题的解决办法可以解决这类问题：查询第N高的数据
2） limit字句的用法
3） ifnull的用法
```


# Write your MySQL query statement below 
## method 1:
IFNULL()
```ruby
SELECT IFNULL(
     # only these lines would return empty value (not NULL!)
     (SELECT DISTINCT salary 
     FROM Employee
     ORDER BY salary DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary; 
```
 
## method 2:
find second max salary
```ruby
SELECT IFNULL(
    (SELECT max(salary) 
     FROM Employee
     WHERE salary < (
        SELECT max(salary) 
        FROM Employee
     )  # or: `NOT IN`
     ORDER BY salary DESC)
     , NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```     


## method 3:
selecting from an empty table would return null
```ruby
SELECT 
    (SELECT DISTINCT salary 
     FROM Employee
     ORDER BY salary DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```

# 608. Tree Node

[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-node/)

### similar to Q178. method 2

- subtable with one column cannot be used `IN` directly!\
  need to select items from the subtable, then use `IN`.\
  However:\
  if just `SELECT items FROM ...`, we can use `IN` directly. (like this problem does)
- 同时对比来自一个表的item时，可以用select另建subtable来实现。
- `CASE WHEN ... THEN ... END`\
  条件语句之间不需要逗号分开。\
  similar to "if...else" clause, following conditions will be executed if the former not satisfy (conditions are exclusivelly).
- `IN`, `NOT IN`\
  comaprison objects (true, false, unknown)
- `LEFT JOIN` on different keywords\
  LEFT JOIN returns *all* records from the left table (table1), **and** the *matching records* from the right table (table2).

## Solutions
- Method 1:\
  使用不同type's property来判断：\
  build subtable to check.\

  \
  **注意!**\
  `WHERE p_id IS NOT NULL`语句必须要加上！\
  原因：\
  `NOT IN` returns 0 records (null), when compared against an unknown value.\
  SQL uses three-value logic, for which the three possible values of a logical expression are true, false or unknown. Comparison of a value to a NULL is unknown and if any one of those NOT IN comparisons is unknown then the result is also deemed to be unknown.\
  这句话可以clear up ambiguity。
```ruby

SELECT id,
       (CASE WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
             WHEN id NOT IN 
                           (SELECT DISTINCT p_id
                            FROM Tree
                            WHERE p_id IS NOT NULL) THEN 'Leaf'
             ELSE 'Inner'
        END) AS type
FROM Tree; 

```


- Method 2:\
  use `LEFT JOIN` with `id = p_id` connection + type's property.\
  `LEFT JOIN`: returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2).\

```ruby

SELECT DISTINCT t1.id AS id,
       (CASE WHEN t1.p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
            WHEN t1.id = t2.p_id THEN 'Inner'
            ELSE 'Leaf'
       END) AS type
FROM Tree t1 LEFT JOIN Tree t2
ON t1.id = t2.p_id

```

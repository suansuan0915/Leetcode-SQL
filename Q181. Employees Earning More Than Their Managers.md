## Things to notice
- SELF JOIN VS. comma
  `table1 JOIN table1`\
  equals to:\
  `table1, table1`
  
## 思路
首先思考：要把表变为什么format才方便比较选择?\
ideally, each row should be like:\
`employee_id | employee_name | employee_salary | ManagerId | manager_id | manager_name | manager_salary`
hence, self-join here.\
self join tables on ManagerId = manager_id (which is "id" in the table)

## Solutions
- Method 1:\
```ruby

SELECT a1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee a1 , Employee a2
WHERE a1.managerId = a2.id AND a1.salary > a2.salary;

```

OR:

```RUBY

select A.name as Employee
from Employee as A join Employee as B
on A.ManagerId = B.Id
where A.Salary > B.Salary;

```

WRONG:
```
SELECT a1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee a1 JOIN Employee a2
ON a1.id = a2.id
WHERE a1.managerId = a2.id AND a1.salary > a2.salary;
```

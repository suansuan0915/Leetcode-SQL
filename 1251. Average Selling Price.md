Get avg_price "for each products": including all products in parent table `Prices`.

### Solutions
- Option 1:\
  More straight-forward.
```sql
SELECT
    t1.product_id,
    IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(price*units)/SUM(units), 2), 0) AS average_price
FROM Prices t1
    LEFT JOIN UnitsSold t2
        ON t1.product_id = t2.product_id
            AND (purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date)
GROUP BY product_id;
```

- Option 2:\
  use `CASE WHEN`.
```sql
SELECT
    t1.product_id,
    (CASE WHEN ISNULL(SUM(units)) THEN 0
        ELSE ROUND(SUM(price*units)/SUM(units), 2) 
        END) AS average_price
FROM Prices t1
    LEFT JOIN UnitsSold t2
        ON t1.product_id = t2.product_id
            AND (purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date)
GROUP BY product_id;
```

# 177. Nth Highest Salary

[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-highest-salary/)

## 思路
similar to Q176.

## Problems to notice

- `LIMIT a, b`\
  equals to\
  `LIMIT b OFFSET a`

- WRONG `LIMIT n-1, 1`:\
  MySQL自定函数中的参数是静态参数，即要先定义后使用。\
  `LIMIT` cannot recognize expressions with arithmetic operators. \
  we have to do the math before `LIMIT`.

- declare variable\
  [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11754781/how-to-declare-a-variable-in-mysql)
  - local variable:\
    `DECLARE variable_name data_type [DEFAULT value]`\
    OR:
    ```
    DECLARE var data_type;
    SET var=VALUE; 
    ```
    this should be in `BEGIN... END` block, and before `RETURN`.
  - user-defined variable:
  
- Duplicate values\
  the test cases include duplicates like first three rows are 100 then 200 and you want 2nd highest--first thing is to get rid of duplicates in a sorted descending list.
  
- IF statement:\
  `IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)`

- `COUNT(0)`, `COUNT(1)`, `COUNT(*)`\
  Count will give you non-null record number of given field.\

  since there is only one non-null value you will get 1 as output.

- Every derived table must have its own alias.

## Solutions
- Method 1:\
  此方法不是很符合题意，因为给的不是一句sql，而是 1个变量定义 + 1个sql clause.
```mysql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE offset_n INT;
    SET offset_n = N-1;   #or: DEFAULT (N-1);
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT (
            IFNULL( 
            (SELECT DISTINCT salary
            FROM Employee
            ORDER BY salary DESC
            LIMIT offset_n, 1), null)
      )     
  );
END

```

- Method 2:
```mysql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      IFNULL((SELECT DISTINCT salary
      FROM
      (SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS ranks
      FROM Employee ) t
      WHERE ranks = N), null)
  );
END
```

- Method 3:\
  use only SQL clause.\
  find min of top N salary (distinct).
```mysql

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT IF(M < N, null, min_salary)
      FROM
      (
          SELECT min(salary) AS min_salary, COUNT(1) AS M 
          FROM
              (SELECT DISTINCT salary 
              FROM Employee
              ORDER BY salary DESC
              LIMIT N) AS Table1
       ) AS Table2
  );
END

```

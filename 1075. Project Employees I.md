# [1075. Project Employees I](https://leetcode.com/problems/project-employees-i/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

Easy

### Notes

- **Aggregate functions cannot be nested!!!!!**\
  `AVG(SUM(...))` is WRONG.

- SIMILAR to [1251. Average Selling Price](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)\
  "for each project": include all projects in `Project` table.\
  -> **Which column is used for GROUP BY,** then include all of that column values (This Column Parent Table **LEFT JOIN** another table).\
  Don't be misled by "for all employees".

### Solutions
```sql
SELECT
    project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project t1
    LEFT JOIN Employee t2
        ON t1.employee_id = t2.employee_id
GROUP BY project_id;
```

# 180. Consecutive Numbers

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/)

# 思路
"find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively"\
-> appear >= 3 times;
-> consecutively: id are consecutively.

## Things to notice
- UNION VS. JOIN\
  **UNION**: is used to combine the result sets of 2 or more SELECT statements.\
            combine rows after rows to be a table.\
            `UNION` removes duplicate rows between the various SELECT statements.\
            `UNION ALL` does not remove duplicate rows.
            each SELECT statement in UNION must have same number of columns.
  **JOIN**: combine columns from two tables. \
            Joins indicate how SQL should use data from one table to select the rows in another table.
            
- comma vs. JOIN\
  if use comma to join tables, no `ON` statement needed, BUT `WHERE` statement needed!\
  if use `JOIN`, `ON` statement needed.

## Solutions
WRONG!
```
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1 JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id = l2.id
JOIN Logs l3 ON l2.id = l3.id
WHERE l1.num = l2.num and l2.num = l3.num and l1.id + 1 = l2.id and l1.id + 1 = l3.id;

```

CORRECT!
```ruby
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3  
WHERE l1.id + 1 = l2.id and l2.id + 1 = l3.id and l1.num = l2.num and l2.num = l3.num;

```

OR: 

```ruby

SELECT DISTINCT l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1 JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id + 1 = l2.id
JOIN Logs l3 ON l2.id + 1 = l3.id
WHERE l1.num = l2.num and l2.num = l3.num;

```

- Method 2:\
Optimal!\
**window function**
```ruby

SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    (SELECT num, 
            id,
            lag(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) as num1,
            lag(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) as num2
    FROM Logs) AS L2
WHERE L2.num = L2.num1 AND L2.num = L2.num2; 

```

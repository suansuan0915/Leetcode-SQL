-> consecutively: id are consecutively.

## Things to notice
- UNION VS. JOIN\
  **UNION**: is used to combine the result sets of 2 or more SELECT statements.\
            combine rows after rows to be a table.\
            `UNION` removes duplicate rows between the various SELECT statements.\
            `UNION ALL` does not remove duplicate rows.
            each SELECT statement in UNION must have same number of columns.
  **JOIN**: combine columns from two tables. \
            Joins indicate how SQL should use data from one table to select the rows in another table.
            
- comma vs. JOIN\
  if use comma to join tables, no `ON` statement needed, BUT `WHERE` statement needed!\
  if use `JOIN`, `ON` statement needed.

## Solutions
WRONG!
```
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1 JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id = l2.id
JOIN Logs l3 ON l2.id = l3.id
WHERE l1.num = l2.num and l2.num = l3.num and l1.id + 1 = l2.id and l1.id + 1 = l3.id;

```

CORRECT!
```ruby
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3  
WHERE l1.id + 1 = l2.id and l2.id + 1 = l3.id and l1.num = l2.num and l2.num = l3.num;

```

OR: 

```ruby

SELECT DISTINCT l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1 JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id + 1 = l2.id
JOIN Logs l3 ON l2.id + 1 = l3.id
WHERE l1.num = l2.num and l2.num = l3.num;

```

# [1555. Bank Account Summary](https://leetcode.com/problems/bank-account-summary/description/)

Medium

### Notes

We need to find SUM(credit, sum_of_all_trans_amount).\
---> So first UNION ALL paid_by and paid_to id and their amount, aggregate to get sum as sum_of_all_trans_amount.\
Then UNION ALL with initial credit, aggregate to get final sum and check if final_sum < 0.



### Solutions

```mysql
SELECT user_id, 
    (SELECT user_name FROM Users WHERE user_id = t1.user_id) as user_name,
    SUM(trans_amt) AS credit,
    IF(SUM(trans_amt)<0, 'Yes', 'No') AS credit_limit_breached
FROM
(
    SELECT  
        user_id,
        SUM(amt) AS trans_amt
    FROM
        (SELECT 
            paid_by AS user_id, -amount AS amt, transacted_on
        FROM Transactions
        UNION ALL
        SELECT 
            paid_to AS user_id, amount AS amt, transacted_on
        FROM Transactions) t
    GROUP BY user_id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user_id, credit AS trans_amt
    FROM Users
) t1
GROUP BY user_id, user_name;
```

## Window function for moving average/sliding window aggregation
Window function for moving average: there can be a sliding window frame inside OVER().\
     e.g.: ` SUM(col) OVER(PARTITION BY xxx ORDER BY xxx [window frame])`. 
     
Window frame: \
**ROWS** (specify the window frame in relation to the current row).\
       Syntax: `ROWS BETWEEN lower_bound AND upper_bound`\
     *bound*:  `CURRENT ROW` / `N PRECEDING` / `N FOLLOWING` / `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` / `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` 

### Solutions
- Method 1:\
  Window function for moving average.
```mysql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        visited_on
        , SUM(amount) AS daily_amount
    FROM Customer
    GROUP BY visited_on
)

SELECT visited_on
    , SUM(daily_amount) OVER(ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS amount
    , ROUND(AVG(daily_amount) OVER(ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS average_amount
FROM cte
LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 6
```

- Method 2:\
  Note:
  - use `SUM()/7` for average_amount, instead of `AVG()`:\
  becoz we are calculating daily average for 7-day window. But AVG() here average on all records in that 7-day window, in which there can be quite a few customers per day.
  - use `t.visited_on` instead of `visited_on`:\
    becoz we use the outside table's visited_on as comparison object.
```mysql
SELECT 
    visited_on
    , (
        SELECT SUM(amount)
        FROM Customer
        WHERE visited_on BETWEEN SUBDATE(t.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND t.visited_on
    ) AS amount
    , 
    (
        SELECT ROUND(SUM(amount)/7, 2)
        FROM Customer
        WHERE visited_on BETWEEN SUBDATE(t.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND t.visited_on
    ) AS average_amount
FROM Customer t
WHERE visited_on >= (
    SELECT ADDDATE(MIN(visited_on), INTERVAL 6 DAY)
    FROM Customer
)
GROUP BY visited_on
ORDER BY visited_on
```

### Edge Case
What if ALL weights are smaller than 1000:\
use MAX(total_weight) <= 1000, instead of MIN(total_weight) >= 1000.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  window function.
  
```mysql
WITH cte AS
(
    SELECT 
        person_name
        , turn
        , SUM(weight) OVER(ORDER BY turn) AS total_weight
    FROM Queue
)

SELECT person_name
FROM cte
GROUP BY person_name
HAVING MAX(total_weight) <= 1000
ORDER BY total_weight DESC
LIMIT 1
```

- Method 2:\
  group by customers who step on the bus, then find their sum, select the max one <= 1000.\
  (t1.people is the last one stepping on the bus, all people on the bus for sum calculation are whose turn <= t2.turn).

```mysql
SELECT
    t1.person_name
FROM Queue t1
    INNER JOIN Queue t2
        ON t1.turn >= t2.turn
GROUP BY t1.turn
HAVING SUM(t2.weight) <= 1000
ORDER BY SUM(t2.weight) DESC
LIMIT 1
```

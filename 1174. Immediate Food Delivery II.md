# 1174. Immediate Food Delivery II

Medium

### Notes

Prefer normal to window function (if consider efficiency).

Use `MIN`, `MAX` to replace `RANK() OVER()`.

### Solutions

- Option 1:\
  Intuitive, but window function is low efficiency.
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(state)/COUNT(1)*100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        delivery_id,
        customer_id,
        order_date,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS order_rank,
        customer_pref_delivery_date,
        (customer_pref_delivery_date = order_date) AS state
    FROM Delivery
    ) t
WHERE order_rank = 1;
```

- Option 2:\
  `MIN()` instead of window function `rank() over()`.
```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(customer_pref_delivery_date = order_date)*100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery 
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN
(
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
;
```

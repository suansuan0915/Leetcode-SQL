- Wrong:\
  max(num) + group by num. This means for each num(group by), it gets the maximum value for num, which is nothing but that num itself.\
  Therefore, a separate `SELECT FROM subquery` statement is needed.
  ```
  SELECT MAX(num) AS num
  FROM MyNumbers
  GROUP BY num
  HAVING COUNT(1) = 1;
  ```

### Solutions
```sql
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(1) = 1
) t
;
```

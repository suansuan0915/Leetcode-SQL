Medium

### Notes

- Get month from date:\
  for example, a date like `2024-01-25`:
  - `MONTH(date_given)` gives 1 as month.
  - `DATE_FORMAT(date_given, '%Y-%m')` gives 2024-01 as month.
 
### Solutions
```sql
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS `month`,
    country,
    COUNT(*) AS trans_count,
    SUM(state = 'approved') AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    SUM(IF(state='approved', amount, 0)) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY `month`, country;
```

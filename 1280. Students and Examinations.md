Easy

### Notes

- `JOIN`\
  `table1 JOIN table2` is different from `table1 JOIN table2 ON ...`.\
  `table1 JOIN table2` equals to `table1 CROSS JOIN table2`.

- Understand the exact output required.\
  Here, we want to record none or >=1 times of exams for every student.

### Solutions
```sql
SELECT 
    t1.student_id, student_name, t2.subject_name,
    COUNT(t3.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM 
    Students t1
    CROSS JOIN Subjects t2
    LEFT JOIN Examinations t3
        ON t1.student_id = t3.student_id
            AND t2.subject_name = t3.subject_name
GROUP BY t1.student_id, student_name, t2.subject_name
ORDER BY t1.student_id, t2.subject_name;

```
